# **You Can Never Have Too Much SASS**

Are you tired of repetition and continuously repeating a line of CSS coding over and over? SASS or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets, a styling language is your answer to that, it helps coders like yourself reduce that repetition a lot while being able to maintain all the hardships of the traditional CSS. Although there are many other options for preprocessors, SASS comes out on top as the most favorable. An easy-to-use preprocessor that can help web developers working on scale styling and large-scale projects, making your coding faster and more efficient.

By definition a CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS, it will turn CSS code with minor syntax variations into regular CSS3. One of the easiest preprocessors to use SASS makes CSS a lot more manageable. To use SASS, you must first have ruby installed. Its main benefits are that it allows the coder to create variables, nested rules, mixin functions, mathematical calculations, and splits large CSS files into different files to make them more manageable. This in return makes the coding go more smoothly. One of the most important things is that SASS has two types of syntaxes, files with. SASS extension and files with the. SCSS extension. With the .sCSS file when coding it will be converted to a CSS file. Now not only will you be able to code more easily but the file gets converted into CSS. Moving onto variables, being able to declare them shows how advanced yet easy SASS is, it allows users to create and set variables for different colors and fonts and use them in any file. Onto nesting, this is a necessary feature SASS uses because it lets the coder modify and maintain it in a way that reduces the amount of extra coding you would have originally had to do. The amount of efficiency that goes with it makes the coding more maintainable.

Another interesting feature that SASS implements is the mixin function, this is a selector that can accept parameters. It is declared as @mixin and what it does is that it lets you create groups of CSS declarations that you want to keep using and reuse them throughout your site. It also accepts passing values as well. With the mixin feature, it helps you keep your declarations all in order and convenient for your usage. When SASS splits large CSS files into smaller ones these are called partials. They’re snippets of that very same CSS file making it easier to maintain. This feature here stands out the most with SASS because most of the time larger files can be overwhelming to scroll through. Keep in mind there are in a lot of cases over thousands of lines of codes and to be able to keep up this feature makes it somewhat stress-free. No more having to constantly scroll up and down to find the piece of code that you’re looking for. These code snippets will relieve some of the stress and amount of coding you’re viewing in the CSS file.

SASS contains many built-in functions that allow the manipulation of CSS codes. A good example would be the Math function, usually used and supported in another programming such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication can be used in CSS coding. These features put SASS ahead of other preprocessors and help coders such as ourselves be swifter and more efficient when tackling projects whether they be small or large in scale. SASS is one of those preprocessors you need in your inventory no matter what. Web and app development has never been made much easier than this, and it is only going to get better from here. The amount of innovation in this preprocessor just shows to go how efficient it can make your CSS coding.

As mentioned before there are other preprocessors other than SASS, there is less and stylus. Stylus was actually modeled after SASS and is considered to be dynamic and flexible with its language and syntax and just like SASS, it has features such as functions, mixins, and variables. Next up is less which stands for Leaner stylesheets and just like the other two it has many built-in features but is stricter with its syntax and is more similar to CSS in this case. In some ways both stylus and less are like SASS with bits and pieces taken from it. But in the end, it seems as though SASS is the winner in this case when it comes to being the better preprocessor. Each preprocessor has its pros and cons in its own right, and by comparing them all you can see which one is a better standout. SASS is a tool that is great for helping web developers and their web pages, by enhancing their basic programming functions and it is easy and quick to learn. SASS implements many things and helps web developers stay organized and efficient without having to change too much of their own way of coding when they originally used CSS. It helps coders who are used to and proficient in CSS in a way that makes their code more efficient, the saying goes work smarter not harder when it comes to coding.
